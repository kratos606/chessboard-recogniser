The primary steps involve gradient computation using Sobel filters and line detection using a Hough-like transformation. The program processes the following steps:\n",

        "*   Gradient Detection: The x and y gradients of the chessboard image are calculated using Sobel filters to highlight the edges along the gridlines of the chessboard.\n",
        "*   Line Detection: The Hough-like transformation identifies the positions of the horizontal and vertical lines on the board.\n",
        "*   Line Pruning: Extra or irrelevant lines near the margins are pruned to ensure only valid chessboard gridlines remain.\n",
        "*   Tile Extraction: Once the gridlines are identified, the script extracts the individual squares from the chessboard and resizes each square to 32x32 pixels for further processing.\n",
        "*   Image Saving: Each square is saved as a separate image, named according to its position on the board using standard chess notation (e.g., `A1.png`, `B2.png`).\n",
        "\n",
        "This script automates the task of splitting chessboard images into smaller, labeled tiles, which can be used as training data for machine learning models or for chess-related computer vision tasks. The program can be used with a folder of input images, and it outputs the individual chessboard tiles into a specified directory."

        "This section of code implements an automated image processing pipeline for extracting chessboard squares from input images. The program specifies input and output directories within Google Colab, allowing users to easily manage image files. The `main()` function scans the specified input folder for image files (PNG, JPG, JPEG), processes each image to identify and extract squares, and saves the resulting tiles into the designated output folder. The processing includes grayscale conversion, gradient computation, adaptive thresholding, and tile resizing, facilitating efficient chessboard analysis and tile generation."
